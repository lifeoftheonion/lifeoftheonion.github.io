    <p><strong>Cambridge, UK</strong> - The Board of Directors at eLife decided to fire their editor-in-chief, Michael Eisen because he tweeted a satirical Onion piece on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "Of course, we had to fire him. People on twitter asked us to do so," an anonymous research fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute told us.</p>
	
    <p>"We adhere to our internal policy on social media use and public onion. Sorry, I mean, public opinion," stated another founding member of eLife, currently director at the Max Planck Institute. He too, chose to talk to us anonymously. "Of course I will stay anonymous. You see, if I were to speak my mind publicly and the public happened to not like what I said, then I would have to fire myself too. Following such a chain of events, eLife would soon be in a pickle." The Board of Directors had one only choice: to put Michael Eisen on their blacklist named eDeath. Their virtuous act indeed served the aims of this scientific journal and it immediately increased eLife's scientific credibility and prestige, as shown by the instant doubling of their impact factor from 8.713 to 17.426.</p>
	
    <p>When asked about the future plans of the journal, one anonymous deputy editor told us: "We will make sure to prevent any further scallions. Sorry, I mean, scandals."</p>
